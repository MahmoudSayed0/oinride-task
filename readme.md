# ControlWire Robot Control Interface

This project is a lightweight screening task built with React and Tailwind CSS. It simulates a real-world robot control interface that includes interactive elements such as a joystick, control buttons, and a live, 3D scene using Three.js.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to convert a static UI design into a working interactive screen. The interface features a live video-like feed through a realistic 3D scene, making the experience more immersive. By integrating Three.js, the application simulates a dynamic environment that behaves like a live video feed.

> **Note:**  
> The UI/UX is considered a secondary priority and may take more time to perfect. Therefore, I focused more on building robust functionality and clear functions rather than on the final visual polish of the UI.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:**  
  Developed using React and Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive design across devices.

- **Interactive Controls:**

  - **Joystick:**  
    Smooth movement within a circular boundary with support for both mouse and touch events.
  - **Control Buttons:**  
    Includes drive mode, speed selectors, lighting options, emergency stop, and more.
  - **Top HUD:**  
    Displays system metrics like distance, runtime, battery status, and other vital information.

- **Realistic 3D Environment:**  
  Utilizes Three.js to render a live, interactive 3D scene that gives the impression of a live video feed.

- **Extensible Functions:**  
  The focus was on delivering strong functionality with plenty of functions, so the overall UI is functional and can be further enhanced with more time.

## Technologies Used

- **React** – For building the UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For rapid and responsive styling.
- **Three.js (via react-three-fiber)** – To create the realistic 3D live scene.
- **TypeScript** – For type-safe code and improved development experience.

## Responsive Design

The interface is fully responsive with optimized layouts for:

- Desktop workstations
- Tablets
- Mobile devices

Key responsive features:

- Collapsible information panels on mobile
- Scaled controls for different screen sizes
- Optimized touch interactions for mobile use
- Adaptive layout with priority information maintained on smaller screens

## Installation & Setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/controlwire.git
   cd controlwire
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
